## Pipeline Architecture & Decoupled Design

The system splits package management and reboot orchestration into two decoupled, independent pipelines to avoid mixing update notifications with reboot lifecycles:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph P1 ["1. Outstanding Updates Pipeline (Daily @ 08:00)"]
        A[check-updates.timer] --> B[check-updates.sh]
        B --> C{Pending Updates?}
        C -->|Yes| D[Dispatch NTFY: Updates Available + Action Button]
        C -->|No| E[Log: Clean & Ping Healthchecks]
    end
```    
```mermaid
    subgraph P2 ["2. Conditional Reboot Pipeline (Daily @ 03:00)"]
        F[conditional-reboot.timer] --> G[conditional-reboot.sh]
        G --> H{Reboot Required?}
        H -->|No| I[Log: No Reboot Required]
        H -->|Yes| J{Safety Checks: Window, Sessions, Locks}
        J -->|Blocked| K[Dispatch NTFY: Reboot Deferred]
        J -->|Passed| L[Dispatch NTFY: Reboot Scheduled]
        L --> M[Execute shutdown -r +5]
    end
```

### Key Architectural Separation

| Pipeline | Trigger / Schedule | Responsibility | Telemetry Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Outstanding Updates** | `check-updates.timer` (Daily @ 08:00) | Scans repositories for available packages waiting to be upgraded. | `📦 Updates Available` (includes interactive `[🚀 Apply All Updates]` button). |
| **Conditional Reboot** | `conditional-reboot.timer` (Daily @ 03:00) | Evaluates post-installation reboot flags (`/run/reboot-required` / `needs-restarting -r`). | `🔄 Reboot Scheduled` (when safe) or `ℹ️ Reboot Deferred` (when blocked). |

#### Why Decouple These Pipelines?
1. **Systems with Available Updates That Do Not Require a Reboot**: A host can have pending package upgrades without needing a restart. Decoupling ensures you are alerted to pending updates without false reboot warnings.
2. **Systems Needing a Reboot with No Further Updates**: A host that installed a kernel patch during an automated cycle may have zero outstanding updates but still needs a clean reboot.
3. **Collision Safety**: Keeping update scanning independent from reboot execution ensures maintenance windows are reserved strictly for safe reboot orchestration.

## 3-Topic Fleet Architecture & Watchdog Routing

To avoid alert fatigue, enforce strict separation between observers and administrators, and enable tailored notification policies across mobile and desktop devices, the pipeline routes notifications through three distinct functional channels under a unified group namespace:

### Endpoint Naming Format
All NTFY endpoints are structured using a high-entropy 16-character random hex prefix coupled with the site's dynamic system group name:
```text
https://ntfy.sh/<16_RANDOM_HEX_CHARS>-<SYSTEM_GROUP_NAME>-<SUBTOPIC>
```
*Note: NTFY topics are strictly flat namespaces (max 64 characters: `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `-`, `_`). The subtopic suffix (`-alerts`, `-reboot`, `-control`) is joined via hyphens, ensuring compliance with NTFY HTTP API routing.*

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Alerts_Channel ["1. Alerts Topic: ...-<SYSTEM_GROUP_NAME>-alerts (Urgent / Alarm)"]
        A1[systemd-failure-notify.sh] --> A[Observer / Alerts Stream]
        A2[Script Crashes / failure_handler] --> A
        A3[Failed Package Installations] --> A
        A4["Healthchecks.io Watchdog (Down Event)"] -.-> A
    end

    subgraph Reboot_Channel ["2. Reboot Topic: ...-<SYSTEM_GROUP_NAME>-reboot (High Priority Chime)"]
        R1[conditional-reboot.sh: Scheduled in 5m] --> R[Reboot Lifecycle Stream]
        R2[conditional-reboot.sh: Deferred] --> R
        R3[post-boot-notify.sh: Boot Successful] --> R
    end

    subgraph Control_Channel ["3. Control Topic: ...-<SYSTEM_GROUP_NAME>-control (Action Buttons & Listener)"]
        C1[check-updates.sh: Updates Available] --> C[Control & Action Stream]
        C2[Interactive Apply Updates Buttons] --> C
        C3[remote-update-listener.sh Listener] <--> C
    end
```

### Channel Routing & Purpose

| Subtopic | Topic Format | Intended Purpose | Urgency Level | Access & Security Model |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`alerts`** | `<hex>-<group>-alerts` | Critical service crashes, update failures, pipeline errors. | **Max / Urgent** | **Observer Stream**: Dedicated to monitoring and visibility. Observers can see system status without seeing action triggers or buttons. Anyone attempting unauthorized execution on this stream is blocked. **Designated target for Healthchecks.io watchdog down events.** |
| **`reboot`** | `<hex>-<group>-reboot` | Scheduled reboots (5m countdown), deferral notices, and post-boot startup confirmations. | **High** | Alerts operators when a reboot is pending or confirms when a node has successfully returned online. |
| **`control`** | `<hex>-<group>-control` | Outstanding update digests, interactive `[🚀 Apply Updates]` buttons, and the listener daemon. | **Default** | **Strict Access Control**: Dedicated exclusively to interactive triggers and command execution. Protected via mandatory `NTFY_VALID_USER` credentials, 16-round HMAC-SHA256 signatures, single-use nonces, and `clear=true` auto-dismissal. |

### Channel Allocation Map

| Channel | Target Subtopic | Associated Messages & Triggers | Priority | Source Script / Service |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Alerts** | `<hex>-<group>-alerts` | • `🚨 Systemd Execution Failure`<br>• `❌ Updates Failed`<br>• `⚠️ Reboot Aborted`<br>• `🚨 Pipeline Failure`<br>• Healthchecks.io watchdog down/timeout alerts | `urgent` | • `systemd-failure-notify.sh`<br>• `apply-all-updates.sh`<br>• `conditional-reboot.sh`<br>• `common-telemetry.sh` (`failure_handler`)<br>• Healthchecks.io integration |
| **Reboot** | `<hex>-<group>-reboot` | • `🔄 Reboot Scheduled` (5m countdown)<br>• `ℹ️ Reboot Deferred` (active user sessions, outside window, process/file locks)<br>• `✅ Boot Successful` (system back online) | `high` / `default` | • `conditional-reboot.sh`<br>• `post-boot-notify.sh` |
| **Control** | `<hex>-<group>-control` | • `📦 Updates Available`<br>• `📦 Weekly Updates Digest`<br>• `⏳ Updates In Progress`<br>• `✅ Updates Completed`<br>• `[🚀 Apply Updates]` action button POST target<br>• `remote-update-listener.sh` subscription stream | `default` (min priority on button click) | • `check-updates.sh`<br>• `pending-updates-digest.sh`<br>• `apply-all-updates.sh`<br>• `common-telemetry.sh`<br>• `remote-update-listener.sh` |

### Fleet Multi-Host Differentiation
On shared topics spanning multiple machines:
- **Title Prefixing**: All telemetry messages automatically prepend `[<hostname>]` (e.g. `[pond] 🔄 Reboot Scheduled`).
- **Targeted Action Payloads**: Remote action buttons embed target host IDs (`apply_updates:<hostname>:...`) so other nodes sharing the topic ignore non-targeted commands.
- **Security Violation Auditing**: All apparent security violations (unauthorized publishers, forged HMAC signatures, replayed nonces, expired commands) are explicitly logged to syslog with `SECURITY VIOLATION:`.

---

## Collision Prevention & Orchestration Safety

The pipeline guarantees that conditional reboots and package upgrades never collide:

1. **Process-Level Locks**:
   - `conditional-reboot.sh` inspects the system process table for active package managers (`apt`, `apt-get`, `dpkg`, `unattended-upgrade`, `dnf`, `yum`, `rpm`, `check-updates`, `apply-all-updates`).
   - If any upgrade or check is active, `conditional-reboot.sh` logs `Blocked process is active. Deferring reboot.` and defers without scheduling a restart.

2. **Filesystem Lock Inspection**:
   - `conditional-reboot.sh` checks package manager lock files (such as `/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend` on Debian/Ubuntu, `/run/lock/libdnf5` on RHEL 10, `/var/lib/dnf/rpmdb_lock.pid` and `/var/cache/dnf/*_lock.pid` on RHEL 9) using `fuser`. If a lock is held by an active process, reboot is deferred.

3. **Pre-Reboot Grace Delay**:
   - When all safety checks pass, `conditional-reboot.sh` dispatches a high-priority `🔄 Reboot Scheduled` notification and schedules `shutdown -r +5` (5-minute countdown).
   - This grace period gives operators time to cancel an automated reboot (`sudo shutdown -c`) if needed.

4. **Failure Flag Quarantine**:
   - If package installation encounters an error, the pipeline sets `/run/package-update.failed`.
   - `conditional-reboot.sh` refuses to restart the machine until the failure flag is resolved by a subsequent successful run.

5. **Multi-Condition Audit & Persistent Logging**:
   - Instead of exiting on the first failing check, `conditional-reboot.sh` executes a full multi-condition inspection across all safety dimensions:
     - **Hard Blocks**: `package_failure` flag, active package manager locks (`dpkg`, `libdnf5`, `rpmdb`), blocked background processes (`borg`, `rsync`).
     - **Soft Blocks**: `outside_window`, active interactive user sessions (`user_sessions` with UID, terminal PTY, and origin IP).
   - Records the complete audit snapshot to `/var/log/reboot-blocks.log`, syslog, and the NTFY notification body.
   - For design analysis on future session whitelisting and bypass mechanics, see [Problems for Future Me](future-problems.md).

6. **In-Window Silent Retries (15-Minute Evaluations)**:
   - `conditional-reboot.timer` evaluates every 15 minutes across the 02:00–05:00 maintenance window.
   - When a block is encountered inside the window, it sends **exactly one** detailed alert at the start of the blockage (`reboot_deferred_reported`) and continues retrying silently every 15 minutes.
   - If a transient condition clears (e.g. backup job completes, idle SSH terminal disconnects), the next 15-minute retry detects a clean state and initiates the reboot automatically.

## Notification Timing & NTFY Action Buttons

The pipeline supports remote action buttons via NTFY (e.g. `[🚀 Apply All Updates]`):

- **Delayed Execution**:
  If a notification arrives at 3:00 AM and you tap the action button at 3:00 PM (12 hours later), it works seamlessly. The NTFY action button issues a live HTTP request to your host's listener at the exact moment you tap it.
- **Real-Time State Evaluation**:
  When the action button triggers `apply-all-updates.sh`, the script evaluates package status live against current repositories.
- **Reboot Independence**:
  If a reboot occurs between receiving the notification and pressing the button, the system state remains clean (since `/run` flags reside on `tmpfs`). Tapping the button post-reboot simply queries the package manager; if updates were already applied, it safely reports that 0 packages need upgrading.
- **Publisher Verification (ACL)**:
  `remote-update-listener.sh` connects to the structured `/json` stream instead of `/raw`. This filters out keepalive/handshake traffic and enables strict sender authentication via `NTFY_VALID_USER`. If configured, any command not published by the authorized account is rejected with a security log warning.

## Automated Dependency Provisioning & Safe etckeeper Detection

### 1. Automated Cross-Platform Dependency Provisioning

To enable zero-touch bootstrapping across heterogeneous fleets, `deploy.sh` automates the dependency and repository resolution process:

- **RHEL Ecosystem (RHEL 8+, CentOS Stream, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux)**:
  - **Dynamic Version Detection**: Extracts the active major version at runtime from `/etc/os-release` (`VERSION_ID`), with `rpm -E %rhel` fallback, cleanly validating an integer (`8`, `9`, `10`, etc.) across bare-metal and virtual Enterprise Linux hosts.
  - **CodeReady Linux Builder (CRB) / PowerTools**: Automatically activates the CRB (RHEL 9+) or PowerTools (RHEL 8 clones) repository, which is required to satisfy upstream package dependencies for EPEL tools:
    - On registered RHEL nodes: `subscription-manager repos --enable codeready-builder-for-rhel-${rhel_ver}-$(arch)-rpms`
    - On RHEL clones / standard DNF systems: `crb enable` or `dnf config-manager --set-enabled powertools` / `crb`
  - **EPEL Provisioning**: Automatically installs the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) configuration package if not already registered, ensuring `etckeeper` is installable.
  - **Core Tools**: Resolves and installs missing core requirements (`dnf-utils` or `dnf-plugins-core`, `dnf-automatic`, `etckeeper`, `git`, `openssl`, `curl`, `faketime`).
- **Debian / Ubuntu Ecosystem (Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+)**:
  - Automatically updates package indexes and installs missing dependencies (`unattended-upgrades`, `etckeeper`, `git`, `openssl`, `curl`, `faketime`) using `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive`.

### 2. Safe `etckeeper` Repository Detection & VCS Preservation

Managing `/etc` in version control is critical for infrastructure stability, but automated installers often risk re-initializing and overwriting existing repositories. The deployment pipeline enforces strict VCS safety checks:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Inspect etckeeper binary] -->|Present| B{Check VCS Directory in /etc}
    A -->|Missing| C[Log warning & proceed without /etc tracking]
    B -->|/etc/.git, .hg, or .bzr exists| D[Existing Repo Detected]
    B -->|No VCS dir found| E[Uninitialized Repo]
    D --> F[Preserve Existing History]
    F --> G[Run etckeeper pre-install: Stage changes]
    E --> H[Run etckeeper init]
    H --> I[Configure default git author if missing]
    I --> J[Run initial baseline commit]
    G --> K[Deploy updates-notify components]
    J --> K
    K --> L[Run etckeeper post-install: Commit changes]
```

#### Safety Guarantees:
1. **Zero-Destruction Guarantee**: `deploy.sh` checks for the presence of `/etc/.git`, `/etc/.hg`, or `/etc/.bzr`. If an existing VCS repository is found, `etckeeper init` is **never** executed, preserving all past commit history, remotes, branches, and custom hooks.
2. **Pre-Deployment Staging**: If an initialized repository is detected, `deploy.sh` calls `etckeeper pre-install` prior to writing any files, ensuring that any uncommitted local system modifications are staged.
3. **Safe First-Time Initialization**: If `etckeeper` was newly installed or never initialized, the script initializes the repository and creates an initial baseline commit before applying pipeline changes.
4. **Post-Deployment Audit Commit**: Once deployment completes successfully, `etckeeper post-install` commits the exact file additions and permission changes made by `deploy.sh`.

### 3. Idempotent Configuration Merging & Default Reference Annotations

To keep production nodes synchronized with upstream configuration template improvements without clobbering host-specific values:
- **Site-Specific Group Staging (`site-conf/<system-group-name>/`)**: Host and group configurations are staged locally in `site-conf/<group>/99-local.conf` and excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
- **Automated Configuration Generator (`generate-topic.sh`)**: Generates pre-populated site configurations containing two separate, independent cryptographic items: a high-entropy NTFY topic name (for public endpoints) and an isolated 256-bit `FLEET_SECRET` (for private HMAC-SHA256 payload signing).
- **Group-Targeted Deployments (`deploy.sh <system-group-name>`)**: Extracts site configuration from `site-conf/<group>/` and merges it into the operational `/etc/conditional-reboot.conf.d/99-local.conf`.
- **Reference Default Commenting**: When a setting exists in the template (`99-local.conf.example`), `deploy.sh` ensures that exactly one `# Default: <template_setting>` line is placed directly above the node's local active assignment, separated by clean blank-line spacing.
- **Upstream Default Sync**: If an upstream default changes in a future release, subsequent deployments update the `# Default:` comment to reflect the new reference value while strictly leaving the host's custom setting below it untouched.
- **New & Optional Settings**: Any newly introduced parameters (including commented optional parameters like `NTFY_CMD_TOPIC` or `NTFY_VALID_USER`) are automatically appended with their accompanying documentation blocks.
- **Pre-Modification Backups**: Creates timestamped backups (`.YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.bak`, retaining up to 3) before making any modifications.
